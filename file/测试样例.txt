表的创建：
CREATE CLASS mobile_phone_traj (trajectory_id int,user_id int, trajectory char);
CREATE CLASS watch_traj (trajectory_id int,user_id int, trajectory char);
CREATE TJoinDeputyClass tjoin AS SELECT * FROM mobile_phone_traj INTERSECT SELECT * FROM watch_traj;

查询所有元组：
SELECT * FROM mobile_phone_traj;
SELECT * FROM watch_traj;
SELECT * FROM tjoin;

测试数据：
INSERT INTO mobile_phone_traj VALUES (1,1,0-1-1-2-2-3);
INSERT INTO mobile_phone_traj VALUES (2,1,1-2-2-3-3-4-4-5);
INSERT INTO mobile_phone_traj VALUES (3,1,1-1-2-2-5-6);
INSERT INTO watch_traj VALUES (4,1,1-2-3-4-2-3);
CREATE TJoinDeputyClass tjoin AS SELECT * FROM mobile_phone_traj INTERSECT SELECT * FROM watch_traj;
SELECT * FROM tjoin;

INSERT INTO watch_traj VALUES (5,1,1-1-2-2-3-3);
SELECT * FROM watch_traj;
SELECT * FROM tjoin;

DELETE FROM mobile_phone_traj WHERE trajectory_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM mobile_phone_traj;
SELECT * FROM tjoin;
